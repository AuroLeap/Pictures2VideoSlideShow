A "hacky" set of scripts intended to prepare a set of pictures / videos for content on a digital picture frame.

= How to use

== For Windows

NOTE: Currently these scripts are written ad-hoc and without consistent consideration for Linux / Macintosh environments.  This set of scripts is written in Powershell, but should be relatively easy to convert to Python or fix with unix path seperator delimeters.

. Open "BuildAlbum.ps1"
. Scroll down to the comment "Define standard / non-test paths"
. Customize all the attributes here as needed, add elements to the "OutputDefs" folder in order to create multiple outputs.
